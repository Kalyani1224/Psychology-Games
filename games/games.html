                        <b>Children need attention (and love) and when they don’t receive this, they develop strategies
                            to
                            gain negative attention by making their parents angry or worried. This approach to gaining
                            attention becomes more sophisticated as people grow older and they start to use more
                            elaborate
                            strategies. These strategies are psychological games.

                            <br>
                            I believe we all play psychological games to some extent; however, when a person lacks
                            positive
                            human connection in their life, this type of behaviour can become the only way for them to
                            gain
                            connection (which is essential for psychological survival). When someone learns about games,
                            and
                            realises they are doing it themselves, it can lead to new and more positive approaches.</b>

                        <b>In psychological games the payoff to each player depends not only on what every player does
                            but
                            also on what he thinks every player believes, and on what he thinks they believe others
                            believe,
                            and so on. In equilibrium, beliefs are assumed to correspond to reality. Yet psychological
                            games
                            and psychological equilibria allow one to model belief-dependent emotions such as anger and
                            surprise that are problematic for conventional game theory. We are particularly interested
                            in
                            issues of sequential rationality for psychological games. We show that although backward
                            induction cannot be applied, and “perfect” psychological equilibria may not exist, subgame
                            perfect and sequential equilibria always do exist.</b>

                                be played with just two people or a giant group of people, too.

                                To start, one person has to give three statements about themselves to the rest of the
                                group. The trick is: all of the statements won’t be true—two of the statements given
                                should be and one should be a lie.

                                that way (at least in part). Being an introvert or an extrovert is part of your innate
                                temperament — the way that you gain energy and prefer to interact with the world.
                                Introversion and extroversion are both temperaments, and both are normal and healthy.
                                About 30-50 percent of the population are thought to be introverts.
