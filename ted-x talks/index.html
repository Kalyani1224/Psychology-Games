          <h2>Being a Woman in Tech</h2>
          <!-- lead makes the paragraph bigger-->
          <p class="lead">
            Just in case you haven’t heard, it can be hard being a woman in IT. Being taken professionally can be
            difficult and emotionally taxing when you’re forced to be constantly aware of gender and its consequences in
            the office.
            But here I don’t want to lament on the problems women know and experience daily. A never-ending avalanche of
            those posts make the news rounds hourly. And that’s the problem. The issue continues and there’s no action
            taken.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s a high time for a change. And it starts now.

          <h2>Why we have too few women leaders</h2>
          <!-- lead makes the paragraph bigger-->
          <p class="lead">
            Success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women, encapsulating
            and confirming the truth that women in the workplace have long-known to be true. Being likeable and
            successful is difficult, if not entirely impossible in workplace environments where the glass ceiling is so
            low women can only crawl towards equality.
